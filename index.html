      <h1>What is Naegleria fowleri?</h1>
      <p>
        The term "brain-eating amoeba" refers to an infamous microorganism
        scientifically known as Naegleria fowleri. This single-celled organism
        resides in warm freshwater environments, such as lakes, hot springs, and
        poorly maintained swimming pools. Though it may conjure up nightmarish
        images, Naegleria fowleri does not cause harm under normal
        circumstances. It is only when water containing the amoeba enters the
        body through the nose—often during activities like swimming or
        diving—that danger arises.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2><b>History of Naegleria fowleri</b></h2>

    <div class="design1">
      <p>
        The "brain-eating amoeba" is a colloquial term for Naegleria fowleri,
        one of the microscopic amoebas that can cause a rare but deadly brain
        infection known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, PAM. Naegleria
        fowleri was first found in the 1960s when cases of brain infections were
        found in Australia. This organism usually is a single-celled creature
        living in warm freshwater bodies like lakes, hot springs, and poorly
        chlorinated swimming pools. Naegleria fowleri penetrate the human body
        via the nose. Most people get infested with this amoeba while swimming
        or diving in warm freshwater. The amoeba moves up the olfactory nerve
        upon entry into the nasal cavity and eventually reaches the brain, where
        it begins destroying the tissue of the brain. This progresses the
        illness known as PAM, which is rapidly fatal. Other countries have
        reported it, but the infections are scarce and scattered throughout, and
        it is comparatively rare in the United States to have more than a few
        cases reported in any given year, mainly from warmer southern states.
        Public health measures have generally focused on prevention of warm,
        stagnant waters during hot weather, especially during warmer times in
        areas where Naegleria fowleri has been prevalent. Though rare, infection
        cases entail very high case fatality and limited effective treatment, so
        the important issues are education and prevention.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the notion of a "brain-eating" organism is terrifying, it's
        essential to remember that occurrences of PAM are rare. The parasite
        thrives in specific environments and typically affects young, healthy
        individuals carried into warm water adventures. Awareness, education,
        and safe swimming practices can significantly reduce the risks
        associated with this formidable foe, ensuring that our encounters with
        nature remain thrilling rather than threatening.

    <h3>How do we get infected by Naegleria fowleri?</h3>
    <div class="design1">
      <p style="font-size: 20px">
        Infection by the "brain-eating amoeba," or Naegleria fowleri, occurs
        when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose.
        Here's a breakdown of how the infection happens:<br />
        <b> <u>Exposure to Contaminated Water:</u></b> Naegleria fowleri lives
        in warm freshwater environments, like lakes, rivers, hot springs, and
        poorly maintained or unchlorinated swimming pools. People typically
        encounter the amoeba while swimming, diving, or engaging in water sports
        in these types of water bodies. <br /><b>
          <u>Entry Through the Nose:</u></b
        >
        Infection only occurs when contaminated water is under pressure and
        enters through the nasal cavities. It is stated to occur when someone
        dives, jumps, or falls into water in a manner that forces water into the
        nose. The amoeba cannot infect via contaminated water drinking; it has
        to enter the nasal opening. <br />
        <b> <u>Migration to the Brain:</u></b> Once it has entered the nasal
        cavity, Naegleria fowleri enters the olfactory nerve that transmits the
        sense of smell and eventually into the brain. <br />
        <b> <u>Destruction of Brain Tissue:</u></b> If it moves into the brain,
        the amoeba will start destroying the brain tissue resulting in the
        primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which is an inflammation
        destruction of the brain tissue.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>What are the symptoms of infection with Naegleria fowleri?</h4>
    <div class="design1">
      <p>
        Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is the illness caused by the
        brain-eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri. Symptoms start between 1 to 12
        days following infection from contact with contaminated water and then
        rapidly worsen over several days. This is a general outline of how
        symptoms develop:

        <br /><u><b>Early Symptoms (within 1–3 days after infection)</b></u
        ><br />
        Early symptoms are similar to bacterial meningitis. These may
        include:<br />

        Serious and abrupt headache<br />
        Fever<br />
        Nausea and vomiting<br />
        <b><u>Late Symptoms (as the infection worsens)</u></b
        ><br />
        As the Naegleria fowleri infection destroys brain tissue, there is the
        emergence of neurological symptoms, which typically come rapidly:<br />

        Stiff neck<br />
        Sensitive to light<br />
        Disoriented and confused<br />
        Loses balance or coordination<br />
        Seizures<br />
        Hallucinations<br />
        Coma<br />
        Disease Progression and Lethality<br />
        When the symptoms appear, infection progresses rapidly and is usually
        fatal, killing in 3 to 7 days. Almost everybody infected with PAM
        succumbs to death, and survival rate is estimated to be less than 3%. Of
        course, certain patients have survived once receiving aggressive medical
        care.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h5>PREVENTIONS</h5>
    <div class="design1">
      <p>
        Preventing infection with Naegleria fowleri requires keeping exposure to
        contaminated warm freshwater limited. Here are some of the key
        prevention tips:<br />

        <b><u>1. Avoid Warm Freshwater Exposure:</u></b
        ><br />
        Limit Activities in Warm Fresh Water: Avoid swimming, diving, or
        engaging in other water sports in warm fresh water bodies, such as lakes
        and rivers, and hot springs, especially during summer and also in
        regions where Naegleria fowleri has been detected. Be wary of shallow,
        stagnant bodies of water, as Naegleria fowleri thrives there more than
        in any other kind of water.
        <br /><b><u>2. Protect your nose:</u></b
        ><br />
        Use Nose Clips: If you swim or dive in warm freshwater, wearing nose
        clips can prevent water from entering your nasal passages, where the
        amoeba can gain access to the brain. Avoid forcing water up your nose:
        Do not dive or jump into the water or splash forceful water into the
        nostril. Always keep your head out of the water, especially during fresh
        water lakes and rivers.
        <br /><b
          ><u
            >3. Never use untreated or unsterile water to nasal irrigate<br />
            Always Use Sterile Water:</u
          ></b
        >
        Sterile water or distillated water is preferred for practices such as
        use of a neti pot or other nasal rinse devices. Instead, tap water has
        been known to contain low levels of Naegleria fowleri at times, avoid
        its usage for such purposes. Clean the Nasal Devices Appropriately:
        Clean and dry your nasal rinsing devices appropriately after every use.
        <br /><b><u>4. Pool and Hot Tub Hygiene.</u></b
        ><br />
        <b><u>Maintenance of Pools with Right Chlorination:</u></b> Ensure
        chlorinated pools, hot tubs, and other recreational water outlets have
        chlorine at the right concentration, keeping these away from
        contamination. Naegleria fowleri cannot survive in well chlorinated
        water. Check Water Temperature and Maintenance Level. The risk increases
        with rising temperature and poor maintenance. It would require one to
        keep water below 104°F (40°C). Checking chlorine levels regularly.
        <br /><b><u>5. Awareness of Public Health Advisories</u></b
        ><br />
        Stay Informed: Be aware of any advisories regarding Naegleria fowleri in
        local water sources, especially during summer. Follow Guidance on Water
        Activities: Refrain from high-risk activities in natural freshwater
        environments if there is an advisory in your area.
